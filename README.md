# Self-Paced-Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become widely used recently in several industries,
including education. AI can be used in the educational setting to deliver individualized
and engaging learning opportunities. AI tools can be created with the potential to
revolutionize the way students learn, answer their academic questions, and provide a
personalized learning experience that adapts to their unique needs and learning
preferences by using the power of artificial intelligence, natural language processing,
along with other frameworks. These technologies turn conventional teaching strategies
into ones that are more participatory, interesting, and successful. They may give each
student specialized support that improves their learning opportunities and promotes
academic success by attending to their individual needs. The goal of the proposal is to
develop an AI tool that can take questions from students as input and produce pertinent
responses as output. Modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were used
to build the suggested AI tool, allowing it to understand and interpret student questions
in a natural and intuitive way. The user interface was created using the Python Kivy
framework, which guarantees a straightforward and userfriendly layout that is simple
for students to utilize. The end result is a creative and approachable tool that encourages
students to ask for assistance with their academic problems and improves their learning
process.
